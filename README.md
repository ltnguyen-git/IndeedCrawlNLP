# IndeedCrawlNLP

This project pulls job descriptions from the Indeed website(https://vn.indeed.com/) using selenium and beautifullsoup.

Get the general information about the job needs by processing and analyzing the data that have been obtained.

According to the data gathered, the majority of employers demand a lot of experience.

The project can still be improved because this is simply a simple natural language processing project and some words still don't work correctly.
